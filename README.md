# ud-st

This repo contains a web page (with accompanying JavaScript and CSS styling)
for a page that converts text into upside-down backward text or strikethrough
text, using Unicode mappings.

The transformed text is suitable for pasting into non-HTML environments
(e.g., Twitter, Facebook, a terminal emulator), as long as those environments
support UTF-8.

The text transformations are done entirely in-browser, via JavaScript.

There are loads of existing similar web sites out there, but I wrote my own
so that I can control the mappings (especially of the upside-down characters).
