# ud-st

This repo contains a web page (with accompanying JavaScript and CSS styling)
for a page that converts text into upside-down backward text or strikethrough
text, using Unicode mappings.

The resulting output text is suitable for pasting into non-HTML environments
(e.g., Twitter, Facebook, a terminal emulator), as long as those environment
support UTF-8.
